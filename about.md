Full stack developer who likes to think of systems as a whole and not frontend and backend and all things in between. In between things I managed to write a [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024040.do) about something I love the most - programming! 

If you're interested in hiring me, you can reach out to me at "mrchief_2000 AT yahoo DOT com."
